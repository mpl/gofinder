How to get started:
1) make install

2) Edit projects.json according to your needs

3) start the server:
gofind -d projects.json

4) send commands and queries from cli or with chording 2-1.
Available features are:

-gofind pattern 
(where pattern can be a classname, filename, partial path, etc...)
-gofind -r regexp
-gofind list [project]
-gofind set project
(to restrict all following commands/searches to that project. 
to go back to searching through all of them just do:
gofind set all)

5) ...

6) profit!

Notes:

1) a few language specific patterns are already available. For example, you can chord 2-1 "use some_module_name" (without the quotes) to gofind for it to look for the definition of that module in your fortran projects. Same with "call some_subroutine".
some c++ similar patterns are in the works, but not quite there yet. See c++.go file if you want to help with that.

2) some stuff (most probably regexp searches) won't work if not done from chording, as I didn't bother correctly parsing the args and escaping chars for rc/bash/whatever.
